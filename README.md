# tlwn725n (*Wi-Fi* connection script)

A simple *Bash* script to establish a *Wi-Fi* connection for the *[TP-LINK TL-WN725N](https://www.tp-link.com/pl/support/download/tl-wn725n/)* Nano *USB* adapter. Intended for the *[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)* OS, however it should work fine for all Arch-based distros.

## Installation

Clone the *tlwn725n* repository to the local machine.

> \$ git clone <https://github.com/devourerOfBits80/tlwn725n.git>

If you are going to use the *Arch Linux* installation media, clone the repository to a *USB flash drive* or to any different portable mass storage device.

> \$ git clone <https://github.com/devourerOfBits80/tlwn725n.git> /run/media/{user}/{device_identifier}

## Usage

Go to the *tlwn725n* repository folder.

> \$ cd ./tlwn725n

If you are using the installation media, boot the live environment, plug-in the prepared *USB flash drive* to a *USB* port, mount it to the */mnt*, and go to the *tlwn725n* directory.

> \$ mount /dev/sd*XY* /mnt (to list all block devices use the command *lsblk -l*)  
> \$ cd /mnt/tlwn725n

Finally, show all available network interfaces, find out the proper one, and execute the *Wi-Fi* connection script.

> \$ ip link show (the expected interface name should be *wlan0* or something like that)  
> \$ ./tlwn725n.sh -i *wlan0* -s {SSID} -p {PASSWORD} -c PL ({COUNTRY_CODE} is optional, default set to *US*)

You should be able to access the internet now. The generated *[wpa_supplicant](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/wpa_supplicant)* configuration file can be found in the */etc/wpa_supplicant* directory. Its name should look like: *wpa_supplicant-wext-wlan0.conf*.

If you were booting your machine via the installation media, remember to unmount the mounted drive.

> \$ umount /mnt
